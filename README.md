<b>JAM: Junior Achievement Mobile</b>

<u>Goal statement for project:</u>

Create an application for adults involved in or interested in Junior Achievement that incentivizes behavior (volunteer activities, requesting programming, etc.) and creates a social network for those involved to connect as well as share ideas and experiences.

<u>Vision for JAM:</u>

We wanted to create a place for prospective volunteers as well as teachers to be able to see some of the best experiences that both volunteers as well as teachers have had with JA.

<u>How we accomplish this:</u>

JAM is a micro-social network. Guest users are presented with a list of testimonials that have been submitted by other users. For a user to submit content, they must first create a JAM account, which requires an email address and a password.
The key behind JAM is the karma system. We needed a way to incentivize volunteers as well as teachers to continue to post content.
So users can upvote content that other users have submitted. One upvote increases your karma by one.
There is a leaderboard for "Best JA Participants", which ranks users based on their karma. This adds incentive to volunteer so that you can brag to your friends about being at the top of the JAM leaderboards (A great way to introduce people to JA).

<u>Technology:</u>
